            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Ahsan Khalid, a graduate with a BS in Software Engineering from <span> Szabist Islamabad - Pakistan.</span> I specialize in crafting scalable, AI-driven web solutions using modern full-stack technologies. With 3+ years of hands-on experience, I excel in leveraging Next.js, React, and Node.js to build performant SaaS applications, real-time systems, and LLM-integrated platforms that solve complex user problems. My expertise spans end-to-end development, from architecting AI/LLM solutions (like OCR text extraction and chatbots) to optimizing server-side performance with Express.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I engineered AI-powered React applications that boosted user retention, while my freelance work on Upwork involved deploying custom LLM dashboards and WebSocket-driven features to streamline client workflows.</p>

            <p>As a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and Membership Coordinator at MLSA-SZABIST, I organized tech workshops and events, bridging academia and industry trends while fostering innovation. Passionate about open-source, I actively contribute to global projects through Hacktoberfest and GSSoC, enhancing my collaborative coding and technical expertise. I excel in fast-paced, collaborative settings, having competed in META HackerCup, NASA Space Apps, and MLH hackathons, where I built functional prototypes and honed my problem-solving skills. My robust GitHub presence reflects my commitment to community-driven, real-world solutions.</p>
